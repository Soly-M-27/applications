  /*Conclusion: When you set the maxTrack parameter, make sure to enter the necessary amount and not more.
  Since both images are being tracked simultaneously, if one image is up while the other is not, the tracking
  performance will slow significantly and cause more lag. Only when both images are within detection view is
  when tracking will take place accordingly and smoothly.*/
